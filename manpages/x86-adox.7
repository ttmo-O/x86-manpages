.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Performs an unsigned addition of the destination operand (first
operand), the source operand (second operand) and the overflow\-flag (OF)
and stores the result in the destination operand. The destination
operand is a general\-purpose register, whereas the source operand can be
a general\-purpose register or memory location. The state of OF
represents a carry from a previous addition. The instruction sets the OF
flag with the carry generated by the unsigned addition of the operands.

.PP
The ADOX instruction is executed in the context of multi\-precision
addition, where we add a series of operands with a carry\-chain. At the
beginning of a chain of additions, we execute an instruction to zero the
OF (e.g. XOR).

.PP
This instruction is supported in real mode and virtual\-8086 mode. The
operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64\-bit mode.

.PP
In 64\-bit mode, the default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX
Prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers
(R8\-15). Using REX Prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to
64\-bits.

.PP
ADOX executes normally either inside or outside a transaction region.

.PP
Note: ADOX defines the CF and OF flags differently than the ADD/ADC
instructions as defined in Intel® 64 and IA\-32 Architectures Software
Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A.

OF is updated based on result. CF, SF, ZF, AF and PF flags are
unmodified.
