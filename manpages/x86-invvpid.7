.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Invalidates mappings in the translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) and
paging\-structure caches based on INVVPID descriptor specified in the
memory operand.

.PP
Outside IA\-32e mode, the register operand is always 32 bits, regardless
of the value of CS.D; in 64\-bit mode, the register operand has 64 bits
(the instruction cannot be executed in compatibility mode).

.PP
The INVVPID types supported by a logical processors are reported in the
IA32\_VMX\_EPT\_VPID\_CAP MSR (see Appendix A, “VMX Capability Reporting
Facility”). There are four INVVPID types currently defined:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Individual\-address invalidation: If the INVVPID type is 0, the
logical processor invalidates mappings for the linear address and
VPID specified in the INVVPID descriptor. In some cases, it may
invalidate mappings for other linear addresses (or other VPIDs) as
well.
.IP \(bu 2
Single\-context invalidation: If the INVVPID type is 1, the logical
processor invalidates all mappings tagged with the VPID specified in
the INVVPID descriptor. In some cases, it may invalidate mappings
for other VPIDs as well.
.IP \(bu 2
All\-contexts invalidation: If the INVVPID type is 2, the logical
processor invalidates all mappings tagged with all VPIDs except VPID
0000H. In some cases, it may invalidate translations with VPID 0000H
as well.
.IP \(bu 2
Single\-context invalidation, retaining global translations: If the
INVVPID type is 3, the logical processor invalidates all mappings
tagged with the VPID specified in the INVVPID descriptor except
global translations. In some cases, it may invalidate global
translations (and mappings with other VPIDs) as well. See the
“Caching Translation Information” section in Chapter 4 of the
Volumes 3A for information about global translations.

.RE

.PP
If an unsupported INVVPID type is specified, the instruction fails.

.PP
INVVPID invalidates all the specified mappings for the indicated VPID(s)
regardless of the EPTP and PCID values with which those mappings may be
associated.

.PP
The INVVPID descriptor comprises 128 bits and consists of a VPID and a
linear address as shown in Figure 30\-2.
