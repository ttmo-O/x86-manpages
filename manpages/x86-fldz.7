.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Push one of seven commonly used constants (in double extended\-precision
floating\-point format) onto the FPU register stack. The constants that
can be loaded with these instructions include +1.0, +0.0,
log210, log2e, π, log102, and
loge2. For each constant, an internal 66\-bit constant is
rounded (as specified by the RC field in the FPU control word) to double
extended\-precision floating\-point format. The inexact\-result exception
(#P) is not generated as a result of the rounding, nor is the C1 flag
set in the x87 FPU status word if the value is rounded up.

.PP
See the section titled “Approximation of Pi” in Chapter 8 of the Intel®
64 and IA\-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for a
description of the π constant.

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non\-64\-bit modes and 64\-bit
mode.

.SH IA\-32 ARCHITECTURE COMPATIBILITY
.PP
When the RC field is set to round\-to\-nearest, the FPU produces the same
constants that is produced by the Intel 8087 and Intel 287 math
coprocessors.
