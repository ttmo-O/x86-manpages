.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Invalidates from every level of the cache hierarchy in the cache
coherence domain the cache line that contains the linear address
specified with the memory operand. If that cache line contains modified
data at any level of the cache hierarchy, that data is written back to
memory. The source operand is a byte memory location.

.PP
The availability of CLFLUSHOPT is indicated by the presence of the CPUID
feature flag CLFLUSHOPT (CPUID.(EAX=7,ECX=0):EBX[bit 23]). The aligned
cache line size affected is also indicated with the CPUID instruction
(bits 8 through 15 of the EBX register when the initial value in the EAX
register is 1).

.PP
The memory attribute of the page containing the affected line has no
effect on the behavior of this instruction. It should be noted that
processors are free to speculatively fetch and cache data from system
memory regions assigned a memory\-type allowing for speculative reads
(such as, the WB, WC, and WT memory types). PREFETCHh instructions or
any of the speculative fetching mechanisms (that is, data can be
speculatively loaded into a cache line just before, during, or after the
execution of a CLFLUSH instruction that references the cache line).

.PP
Executions of the CLFLUSHOPT instruction are ordered with respect to
fence instructions and to locked read\-modify\-write instructions; they
are also ordered with respect to the following accesses to the cache
line being invalidated: older writes and older executions of CLFLUSH.
They are not ordered with respect to writes, executions of CLFLUSH that
access other cache lines, or executions of CLFLUSHOPT regardless of
cache line; to enforce CLFLUSHOPT ordering with any write, CLFLUSH, or
CLFLUSHOPT operation, software can insert an SFENCE instruction between
CLFLUSHOPT and that operation.

.PP
The CLFLUSHOPT instruction can be used at all privilege levels and is
subject to all permission checking and faults associated with a byte
load (and in addition, a CLFLUSHOPT instruction is allowed to flush a
linear address in an execute\-only segment). Like a load, the CLFLUSHOPT
instruction sets the A bit but not the D bit in the page tables.

.PP
In some implementations, the CLFLUSHOPT instruction may always cause
transactional abort with Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX).
The CLFLUSHOPT instruction is not expected to be commonly used inside
typical transactional regions. However, programmers must not rely on
CLFLUSHOPT instruction to force a transactional abort, since whether
they cause transactional abort is implementation dependent.

.PP
CLFLUSHOPT operation is the same in non\-64\-bit modes and 64\-bit mode.
