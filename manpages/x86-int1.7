.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The INT Intel® 64 and IA\-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual,
Volume 1). The destination operand specifies a vector from 0 to 255,
encoded as an 8\-bit unsigned intermediate value. Each vector provides an
index to a gate descriptor in the IDT. The first 32 vectors are reserved
by Intel for system use. Some of these vectors are used for internally
generated exceptions.

.PP
The INT n instruction is the general mnemonic for executing a
software\-generated call to an interrupt handler. The INTO instruction is
a special mnemonic for calling overflow exception (#OF), exception 4.
The overflow interrupt checks the OF flag in the EFLAGS register and
calls the overflow interrupt handler if the OF flag is set to 1. (The
INTO instruction cannot be used in 64\-bit mode.)

.PP
The INT3 instruction uses a one\-byte opcode (CC) and is intended for
calling the debug exception handler with a breakpoint exception (#BP).
(This one\-byte form is useful because it can replace the first byte of
any instruction at which a breakpoint is desired, including other
one\-byte instructions, without overwriting other instructions.)

.PP
The INT1 instruction also uses a one\-byte opcode (F1) and generates a
debug exception (#DB) without setting any bits in DR6.1 Hardware
vendors may use the INT1 instruction for hardware debug. For that
reason, Intel recommends software vendors instead use the INT3
instruction for software breakpoints.

.PP
1\&. The mnemonic ICEBP has also been used for the instruction with
opcode F1.

.PP
An interrupt generated by the INTO, INT3, or INT1 instruction differs
from one generated by INT n in the following ways:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
The normal IOPL checks do not occur in virtual\-8086 mode. The
interrupt is taken (without fault) with any IOPL value.
.IP \(bu 2
The interrupt redirection enabled by the virtual\-8086 mode
extensions (VME) does not occur. The interrupt is always handled by
a protected\-mode handler.

.RE

.PP
(These features do not pertain to CD03, the “normal” 2\-byte opcode for
INT 3. Intel and Microsoft assemblers will not generate the CD03 opcode
from any mnemonic, but this opcode can be created by direct numeric code
definition or by self\-modifying code.)

.PP
The action of the INT n instruction, the EFLAGS register is pushed onto
the stack before the return address. (The return address is a far
address consisting of the current values of the CS and EIP registers.)
Returns from interrupt procedures are handled with the IRET instruction,
which pops the EFLAGS information and return address from the stack.

.PP
Each of the INT n, INTO, and INT3 instructions generates a
general\-protection exception (#GP) if the CPL is greater than the DPL
value in the selected gate descriptor in the IDT. In contrast, the INT1
instruction can deliver a #DB

.PP
even if the CPL is greater than the DPL of descriptor 1 in the IDT.
(This behavior supports the use of INT1 by hardware vendors performing
hardware debug.)

.PP
The vector specifies an interrupt descriptor in the interrupt descriptor
table (IDT); that is, it provides index into the IDT. The selected
interrupt descriptor in turn contains a pointer to an interrupt or
exception handler procedure. In protected mode, the IDT contains an
array of 8\-byte descriptors, each of which is an interrupt gate, trap
gate, or task gate. In real\-address mode, the IDT is an array of 4\-byte
far pointers (2\-byte code segment selector and a 2\-byte instruction
pointer), each of which point directly to a procedure in the selected
segment. (Note that in real\-address mode, the IDT is called the
interrupt vector table, and its pointers are called interrupt vectors.)

.PP
The following decision table indicates which action in the lower portion
of the table is taken given the conditions in the upper portion of the
table. Each Y in the lower section of the decision table represents a
procedure defined in the “Operation” section for this instruction
(except #GP).

.RE

.PP
When the processor is executing in virtual\-8086 mode, the IOPL
determines the action of the INT n instruction. If the IOPL is less than
3, the processor generates a #GP(selector) exception; if the IOPL is 3,
the processor executes a protected mode interrupt to privilege level 0.
The interrupt gate's DPL must be set to 3 and the target CPL of the
interrupt handler procedure must be 0 to execute the protected mode
interrupt to privilege level 0.

.PP
The interrupt descriptor table register (IDTR) specifies the base linear
address and limit of the IDT. The initial base address value of the IDTR
after the processor is powered up or reset is 0.

.PP
Instruction ordering. Instructions following an INT n may be fetched
from memory before earlier instructions complete execution, but they
will not execute (even speculatively) until all instructions prior to
the INT n have completed execution (the later instructions may execute
before data stored by the earlier instructions have become globally
visible). This applies also to the INTO, INT3, and INT1 instructions,
but not to executions of INTO when EFLAGS.OF = 0.

.SH OPERATION
.PP
.RS

.nf
The following operational description applies not only to the INT n, INTO, INT3, or INT1 instructions, but also to
external interrupts, nonmaskable interrupts (NMIs), and exceptions. Some of these events push onto the stack an
error code.
The operational description specifies numerous checks whose failure may result in delivery of a nested exception.
In these cases, the original event is not delivered.
The operational description specifies the error code delivered by any nested exception. In some cases, the error
code is specified with a pseudofunction error\_code(num,idt,ext), where idt and ext are bit values. The pseudofunc\-
tion produces an error code as follows: (1) if idt is 0, the error code is (num \& FCH) | ext; (2) if idt is 1, the error
code is (num « 3) | 2 | ext.
In many cases, the pseudofunction error\_code is invoked with a pseudovariable EXT. The value of EXT depends on
the nature of the event whose delivery encountered a nested exception: if that event is a software interrupt (INT n,
INT3, or INTO), EXT is 0; otherwise (including INT1), EXT is 1.

The EFLAGS register is pushed onto the stack. The IF, TF, NT, AC, RF,
and VM flags may be cleared, depending on the mode of operation of the
processor when the INT instruction is executed (see the “Operation”
section). If the interrupt uses a task gate, any flags may be set or
cleared, controlled by the EFLAGS image in the new task’s TSS.
